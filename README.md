# Image-Processing-Project
An early fire detection system using image processing for waste stations

The framework proposed in this project utilizes Image Processing systems that examine a picture and a signal is used which gives a caution when the mishap will happen, mainly for open environments like waste stations. The system uses a camera to detect fires so there is no requirement for any sensors. The warmth marks and fire patterns in pictures are recognized to discover that it is a fire or not. The fundamental aim of the proposed model is to avoid false alerts and to detect fire as early as possible.
